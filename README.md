# üü£ EvalExpr

![Stack CI workflow](https://github.com/guillaumebgd/EvalExpr/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This project consists in **evaluating a mathematical expression**.<br />
It was realized as a student project during the beginning of my **3rd year** at EPITECH.

### üîé In-depth

The complexity behind the project doesn't come from the main problem itself but from its implementation in Haskell and constraints added by our instructor.

For a bit of context with the constraints:

- The project, for instance, ends up not using **that many keywords**.<br />
`do`, `case`, `if` (and others...) aren't allowed most of the time as we will end up writing imperative code instead of functional.

- For *chaining function calls*, you will mostly see **the application operator** `$` and **the composition operator** `.` being used.

- For *conditions*, you will mostly see **pattern matching** and **guards** being used.

- **Majority of types** used as **parameters** and **return types** of functions are newly created types (via `type`, `newtype` or `data`) for ease of comprehension and logic throughout the program as well as rigorousness in type conversion.

- Almost every type `deriving` from `instances` will use those derived instances in production and not specifically for another environment.<br />
A common example of this bad habit is that usually people derive from `Eq` as it makes testing for those types easier in testing environment.<br />
Deriving from `Eq` when it serves no purpose in the production environment makes no sense and also adds unreacheable code for coverage.
Therefore, we try to reduce this bad habit as much as we can with the tools we are given.
Inside the testing environment, where we need an instance of `Eq` for assertion checking, it is being bypassed by wrapping those types inside wrapping types and making them derive from their own instance of `Eq`.
Most specifically, we wrap the return of the function we are testing and wrapping the component we are using for comparison. As they have matching types, everything perfectly works.
`Exceptions` don't follow this rule because, in testing, we can't wrap the exception that was thrown.

- For this project specifically, we also had to create a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)), of the expression that was given as parameter, before evaluating for a result.

### üî® Build the project

This project has been setup with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and works with a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) that wraps this framework with different rules.

| Command          | Result                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `make`           | Builds a ```funEvalExpr``` executable.          |
| `make tests_run` | Runs unit tests.                                |
| `make clean`     | Cleans build dumps, keeping the executable.     |
| `make fclean`    | Removes all of the files created by the build.  |
| `make re`        | Calls `make fclean` and then `make`.            |

### üöÄ Launch the project

Use the newly created `funEvalExpr` binary file to launch the project.

The expression to evaluate needs to be given as argument to the program as such:
```bash
$ ./funEvalExpr "(3+1.5)*3"
```

The program outputs the result rounded down to *2 decimal places* and returns `0` upon success.

For instance:
```bash
$ ./funEvalExpr "(0.345+5)*(-2-1)/3"
-5.34
```


In case of error with the given arguments (division by 0) or with the expression itself, the program shall display the error, and exit by returning `84`.

### üñãÔ∏è Syntax

#### Operators

The different operators the program understands are the followings:

| Operator | Description         | Binary / Unary |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | Plus sign           | Binary & Unary |
| `-`      | Minus sign          | Binary & Unary |
| `*`      | Multiplication sign | Binary         |
| `/`      | Division sign       | Binary         |
| `^`      | Exponent sign       | Binary         |

#### Parentheses

Parentheses are allowed to influence operation priorities.

#### Spaces

Spaces & tabulations are ignored in the expression.
